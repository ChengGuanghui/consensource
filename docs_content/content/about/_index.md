ConsenSource is a blockchain application to help Retail sourcing employees verify products are sourced sustainably from certified factories. Specifically, this application serves as a common platform to verify and display supplier certifications and audit data between standards bodies, certification bodies, and factories. This application runs on Hyperledger Sawtooth, an enterprise blockchain platform.

This distributed ledger system allows all partners - standards bodies (like FSC), auditing or certifying bodies (like Rainforest Alliance), factories, and retailers (like Target) - to share ownership of this data. Each partner is tasked with the duty of owning their data and keeping this information up to date, shifting the onus of data accuracy to the impacted party.

The blockchain participants uniquely interact with the ConsenSource application. Standards bodies create standards and accredit certifying bodies. These certifying bodies are then able to audit and certify factories against the standards they are accredited for. Factories are able to request these certifications and in-person audits, so that Certifying bodies are able to issue certificates based on in-person, off-chain audit results. This allows Retail sourcing employees to view and trust the resulting data from these interactions as well as general contact and location information on each of these entities.
